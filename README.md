# Computing_Speed_Test

This video talks about 3 ways to find the duplicate number:

Given an array nums containing n+1 integers where each integre is between i and n (inclusive). Prove that at lease one duplicate number
must exist.

After tried the three ways that he used to solve this problem and also inspired by the Big O Notation, I was curious how fast each method could be. So I
tried to simulate each scenario and ideally draw the computing graph for each methods.
